description: 'An app that helps you train your non-dominant hand'
---

Ambi's goal is to help its users become ambidextrous! The app provides habit tracking for daily non-dominant hand activities, hand-strengthening tap games, and guided writing and sports exercises.

Ambi won "Most Innovative" at AngelHacks 2.0 (a hackathon with nearly 900 participants). Check out the [project's page on DevPost](https://devpost.com/software/ambi).
