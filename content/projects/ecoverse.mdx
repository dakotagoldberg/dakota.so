After finishing as a finalist in Google Play's first-ever Change the Game Design Challenge, I worked with Google and Girls Make Games to bring my submission, EcoVerse, to life.

In [EcoVerse](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.LearnDistrict.EcoVerse&hl=en_US&gl=US), players join the Galactic Restoration Team to restore trashed and abandoned planets across the galaxy into beautiful worlds once again thriving with life.
